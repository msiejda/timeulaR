\description{
With this endpoint you can create a new Activity. It should have name and color.
Name doesnâ€™t have to be unique. You can also provide Integration to which Activity
will belong (zei by default, which means no special Integration). You can obtain
list of enabled Integrations with the function \code{\link{integrations}}.
