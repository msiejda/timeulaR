\description{
Tags and mentions are created with use of # and @ prefixes in notes of your
time entries. Moreover if an activity is linked with integration, letâ€™s say
JIRA project, JIRA task IDs are visible as tags. With this endpoint you can
fetch all tags and mentions valid in context of given activity. In this API
version each tag / mention has ID only, while labels are \code{NULL} / \code{NA}.
}
\examples{
token <- "123456789"
tagsAndMentions(activityId = "57302", token, as_df = TRUE)
